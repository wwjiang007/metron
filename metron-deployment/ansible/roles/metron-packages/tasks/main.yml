# copy metron packages to the remote host
#
# the repository on the remote host containing the Metron packages (by default
# located at /localrepo) MUST BE defined on every Ambari slave host.  in most
# cases, this local repository can be empty.  only the local repository hosting
# metron needs to contain the metron packages (either RPMs or DEBs)
#
# 'packages_required'
#
# this variable defines whether the Metron packages need to be copied to the
# repository or whether it can be left empty.  copying the packages can be a
# time consuming operation on a large cluster, so it avoided unless required.
