# ambari uses socket.getfqdn() to find the hostname. with 'localhost.localdomain'
# in '/etc/hosts' this function will report the hostname as 'localhost.localdomain'
# rather than 'node1' as would be expected.  other functions like socket.gethostname()
# will always return 'node1' as expected.  ambari needs to see 'node1' to be able to
# communicate between the master and agents.
