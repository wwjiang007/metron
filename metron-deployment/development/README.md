# Metron Development Environments

This directory contains environments useful for Metron developers.  These environments are not intended for proof-of-concept, testing, or production use.  These are extremely resource constrained and cannot support anything beyond the most basic work loads.

* Metron running on CentOS 6
* Metron running on Ubuntu 14
* Fastcapa


## Vagrant Cachier recommendations

The development boxes are designed to be spun up and destroyed on a regular basis as part of the development cycle. In order to avoid the overhead of re-downloading many of the heavy platform dependencies, Vagrant can use the [vagrant-cachier](http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/) plugin to store package caches between builds. If the plugin has been installed to your vagrant it will be used, and packages will be cached in ~/.vagrant/cache.

## Knox Demo LDAP

The development environment can be set up to authenticate against Knox's demo LDAP.

A couple notes
* A custom LDIF file is used to setup users. This is to get the roles and passwords setup correctly.
* The demo LDAP uses plaintext passwords with no encryption prefix (e.g. {SSHA}).
* You may need or want to shut down any or all of the topologies. This is optional, but clears some room

To setup this up, start full dev.
* In Ambari, add the Knox service (Actions -> +Add Service).  Accept all defaults and let it install. The configs that will be set how we need by default are:
  * LDAP URL = ldap://localhost:33389
  * User dn pattern = uid={0},ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
  * LDAP user searchbase = ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
  * Group Search Base = ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
  * Group Search Filter = member={0}
  * User Base DN = uid=admin,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
  * User Search Filter is empty
  * User password attribute = userPassword
  * LDAP group role attribute = cn
  * Bind User = uid=admin,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
  * LDAP Truststore is empty
  * LDAP Truststore Password is empty
  
* In the Knox configuration, go to "Advanced users-ldif". We have a custom ldif file "knox-demo-ldap.ldif" in "metron-deployment/development" that contains a customized variant of the users and groups defined here. Replace the default ldif configuration with the contents of "knox-demo-ldap.ldif"
* Start the Demo LDAP (In Knox, "Service Actions -> Start Demo LDAP)
* In Metron's configs, we're going to make two changes
  * Set "LDAP Enabled" to "On"
  * In Security, set "Bind user password" to match the admin user's password from the ldif file (admin-password).
* Restart the REST application

Now, when you go to Swagger or the UIs, you should be able to give a user and password.
"admin" will have the roles ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER, which can be verified via the "/whoami/roles" endpoint in Swagger. Similarly, there is a user "sam" that only has ROLE_USER. A third user, "tom" has neither role.

## Common Problems

### Mac Mojave - Operation Not Permitted Error

`tee: /etc/exports: Operation not permitted on macOS 10.14 Mojave with nfs exports`

If you have the Mojave OS or newer, you may run into this issue when running `vagrant up`. In order to correct this you will need to grant permissions to your relevant terminal application.
Navigate to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy` and add your terminal application to "Full Disk Access". See [https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10234](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10234) for more details.
